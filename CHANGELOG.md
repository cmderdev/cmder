* TBD

## [1.3.6-pre2](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/tree/v1.3.6-pre2) (2018-03-01)

* Git updated to v2.16.3.windows.1
* ConEmu updated to 180318

**Updates:**

* Removed all sub routines from `init.bat` and made them into importable libraries that can be used in any `*.bat|cmd` file.
  * Libraries are in `%cmder_root%\vendor\lib`.
  * Import libraries into any `*.bat|cmd` file using `call "%cmder_root%\vendor\lib\[library file name]"`.
  * Call library methods by typing `"%lib_path% enhance_path "c:\bin"`.
  * Get help on library method usage by typing `"%cmder_root%\vendor\lib\[library file name]" /h`.

## [1.3.6-pre1](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/tree/v1.3.6-pre1) (2018-03-01)

**Fixed bugs:**

* Fixed Git version check recently added to master.

**Updates:**

* Modified Cmder tasks in default ConEmu.xml to allow easily adding command line args for init.bat by adding some quotes. This resulted in a ton of misc changes to this file. See Adds below.
* Reworked `cmder.exe` command line argument handling to make it more flexible and easily added to.
* Reworked README.md tables to make them more readable in editors.

**Implemented enhancements:**

* Added `cmder.exe` command line args documentation to `README.md`.
* Added `:enhance_path` method to vendor\init.bat that modifies the path only if required.
  * To prepend: `call :enhance_path "%cmder_root%"`
  * to append: `call :enhance_path "%cmder_root%" append`
* Added `:enhance_path_recursive` method to vendor\init.bat that adds a path and all its sub directories to the path if required.
  * Max recurse depth default is '1' configurable using `init.bat /max_depth [1-5]`. 6+ results in error.
  * To prepend and go 3 levels deep: `call :enhance_path "%cmder_root%" 3`
  * To append and go 2 levels deep: `call :enhance_path "%cmder_root%" 2 append`
* Added ability to init.bat to accept command line args and documented them in README.md. Allows users to change the behaviour of init.bat without editing the file.
