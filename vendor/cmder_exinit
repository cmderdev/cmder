# folder when launched.
#
# The destination file extension depends on the shell you use.  For example:
#
# bash - Copy to /etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.sh
# zsh  - Copy to /etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.zsh
# Add portable user customizations ${CMDER_ROOT}/config/user-profile.sh or
# add whole config scripts to ${CMDER_ROOT}/config/profile.d both will be sourced
# from mthis file and be appied to the environment at startup.
#
# These customizations will follow Cmder if $CMDER_ROOT is copied
# to another machine.
#
# Add system specific users customizations to $HOME/.bashrc, these 
# customizations will not follow Cmder to another machine.

# # Uncomment and edit the CMDER_ROOT line to use Cmder/config even when launched
# # from outside Cmder.
# CMDER_ROOT=${USERPROFILE}/cmder  # This is not required if launched from Cmder.

# Check that we haven't already been sourced.
